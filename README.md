# @passmarked/http 

![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/@passmarked/http.svg) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/passmarked/http.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/passmarked/http)

[Passmarked](http://passmarked.com) is a suite of tests that can be run against any page/website to identify issues with parity to most online tools in one package.

The [Terminal Client](http://npmjs.org/package/passmarked) is intended for use by developers to integrate into their workflow/CI servers but also integrate into their own application that might need to test websites and provide realtime feedback.

All of the checks on [Passmarked](http://passmarked.com) can be voted on importance and are [open-sourced](http://github.com/passmarked/suite), to encourage community involvement in fixing and adding new rules. We are building the living Web Standard and love any [contributions](#contributing).

## Synopsis

The rules checked in this module are:

* **versioning** - The web server included the version in the response headers back to the client, which could lead to attackers easily identifying vulnerabilities in the specific serving version.
* **aspnet** - The ASP.NET version was returned by the server, this allows attackers to both see that ASP.NET is being used and find vulnerabilities specific to that version.
* **aspnetmvc** - The ASP.NET MVC version was returned by the server, this allows attackers to both see that ASP.NET MVC is being used and find vulnerabilities specific to that version.
* **contenttype.missing** - The **x-content-type-options** header was not returned by the server in the document request
* **contenttype.incorrect** - The **x-content-type-options** header was returned but expected at least "nosniff" to be present.
* **frameoptions.missing** - The **x-frame-options** header was not defined.
* **frameoptions.incorrect** - The **x-frame-options** header was not a expected option, one of the following are expected: **DENY**, **SAMEORIGIN** or **ALLOW-FROM**.
* **poweredby** - The **x-powered-by** header was returned, which would allow attackers looking at the headers to easily see which technology/framework to target.
* **xss.missing** - The **x-xss-protection** header was not defined.
* **xss.incorrect** - The **x-xss-protection** header was defined but was expecting the following format **1; mode=block**

## Running

The rules are checked everytime a url is run through Passmarked or our API. To run using the hosted system head to [passmarked.com](http://passmarked.com) or our [Terminal Client](http://npmjs.org/package/passmarked) use:

```bash
npm install -g passmarked
passmarked --filter=http example.com
```

The hosted version allows free runs from our homepage and the option to register a site to check in its entirety.
Using the Passmarked npm module (or directly via the API) integrations are also possible to get running reports with all the rules in a matter of seconds.

## Running Locally

All rules can be run locally using our main integration library. This requires installing the package and any dependencies that the code might have such as a specific version of OpenSSL, see [#dependencies](#dependencies)

First ensure `passmarked` is installed:

```bash
npm install passmarked
npm install @passmarked/http
```

After which the rules will be runnable using promises:

```javascript
passmarked.createRunner(
  require('@passmarked/http'), // this package
  require('@passmarked/ssl') // to test SSL
).run({
  url: 'http://example.com',
  body: 'body of page here',
  har: {log: {entries: []}}
}).then(function(payload) {
  if (payload.hasRule('secure')) {
    console.log('better check that ...');
  }
  var rules = payload.getRules();
  for (var rule in rules) {
    console.log('*', rules[rule].getMessage());
  }
}).catch(console.error.bind(console));
```

Alternatively, callbacks are also available:

```javascript
passmarked.createRunner(
  require('@passmarked/http'),
  require('@passmarked/ssl'),
  require('@passmarked/inspect')
).run({
  url: 'http://example.com',
  body: 'body of page here',
  har: {log: {entries: []}}
}, function(err, payload) {
  if (payload.hasRule('secure')) {
    console.log("better check that ...");
  }
  var rules = payload.getRules();
  for (var rule in rules) {
    console.log('*', rules[rule].getMessage());
  }
});
```

## Dependencies

This module does not need any specific external services or packages. This section will be updated if that ever changes with detailed setup steps/links.

## Rules

Rules represent checks that occur in this module, all of these rules have a **UID** which can be used to check for specific rules. For the structure and more details see the [Wiki](https://github.com/passmarked/passmarked/wiki) page on [Rules](https://github.com/passmarked/passmarked/wiki/Create).

> Rules also include a `type` which could be `critical`, `error`, `warning` or `notice` giving a better view on the importance of the rule.

## Contributing

```bash
git clone git@github.com:passmarked/http.git
npm install
npm test
```

Pull requests have a prerequisite of passing tests. If your contribution is accepted, it will be merged into `develop` (and then `master` after staging tests by the team) which will then be deployed live to [passmarked.com](http://passmarked.com) and on NPM for everyone to download and test.
